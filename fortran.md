### 3. Usage
#### 3.1 CRYSTAL
1. Run SCF.
1. Create a directory, e.g. ```emH-00-50-00-d01```, meaning we are calculating effective mass for holes (VB) **Y** point with ```dk=0.01```.
1. Create ```inp``` file with the desired characteristics in the newly created directory.
1. Run ```emc_gen.x``` to obtain ```KPOINTS``` file.
1. Run ```cry-getE.pl -f ../input.f9 -b 131``` to obtain ```EIGENVAL``` file.  
 **cry-getE.pl** uses the following parameters:
   * SCF output filename (.f9) in ```-f``` flag;
   * band number in ```-b``` flag.
   * Note that ```runprop09``` needs to be in the current ```$PATH```, otherwise script will quit.
1. Run ```emc_calc.x``` to obtain effective masses and directions. Look for ```emc_calc.log``` file.

#### 3.2 VASP
1. Run SCF (e.g. ```ICHARG=2``` in INCAR).
1. Create a directory, e.g. ```emH-00-50-00-d01```, meaning we are calculating effective mass for holes (VB) **Y** point with ```dk=0.01```.
1. Create ```inp``` file with the desired characteristics in the newly created directory.
1. Run ```emc_gen.x``` to obtain ```KPOINTS``` file.
1. Run a non-SCF calculation (```ICHARG=11``` in INCAR). Don't forget to copy ```CHGCAR``` file from SCF folder.
1. Run ```emc_calc.x``` to obtain effective masses and directions. Look for ```emc_calc.log``` file.
