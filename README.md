## Effective Mass Calculator

Effective mass tensor is defined as:  
![Effective Mass Tensor](https://raw.github.com/alexandr-fonari/emc/master/p_ms.gif)  
where ```hbar = 1``` in atomic units (a.u.), and energy gradient tensor is defined in 3D as follows:  
![Energy Gradient Tensor](https://raw.github.com/alexandr-fonari/emc/master/p_et.png).

Second order derivatives are estimated with ```O(h^4)``` error:

Mixed second derivatives are estimated also with ```O(h^4)``` error:
